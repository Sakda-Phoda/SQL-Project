# SQL-Project
This project aimed to demonstrate the fundamental ability to use various functions in querying. The dataset used for this query was generated by ChatGPT.

**The details of each query are as follows:**

Query 1: Query companies of type Ltd, PLC, Inc, and LLC, and count the number of each type.

Query 2: Find the number of transactions, total sales, and average sales. Also, indicate whether the sales performance was above or below average by grouping by month.

Query 3: Query the top 100 customers with the highest purchase amounts, including details such as customer ID, first and last name, email, and phone number. (For this query, there are two codes with the same result, but it is recommended to use the first code as it runs faster.)

Query 4: Analyze the purchase history of the customer with the highest sales, including the purchase dates, products, quantities, and sales amounts. Also, specify the total sales this customer has made with our store from the beginning and the percentage of each purchase.

Query 5: Find the percentile of all customers based on the sales amount each customer achieved.

Query 6: Rank the products with the highest sales, displaying only products in the category with the highest sales.

Query 7: Summarize the sales for each month with a column comparing it to the previous month and showing month-on-month sales.

Query 8: Pivot the sales of all branches to show the monthly sales of each branch.
